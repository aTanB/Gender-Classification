# Gender-Classification
This is the code for the gender classification challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #1' by @Sirajology on Youtube. This code uses different types of classifiers from the scikit-learn machine learning library to predict the gender given a novel set of body metrics(height, width and shoe-size). The classifiers used for this task are :


1.) Decision Tree
2.) KNN
